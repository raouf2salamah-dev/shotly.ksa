# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at https://dart.dev/lints.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
  rules:
    # Security-focused rules
    avoid_print: true  # Avoid leaking sensitive information through print statements
    prefer_single_quotes: true  # Consistent string literals
    avoid_hardcoded_credentials: true  # Prevent hardcoded credentials
    avoid_dynamic_calls: true  # Prevent potential runtime errors
    avoid_returning_null_for_future: true  # Prevent null pointer exceptions
    avoid_js_rounded_ints: true  # Prevent integer overflow issues
    prefer_final_locals: true  # Prevent accidental variable modification
    prefer_final_fields: true  # Prevent accidental field modification
    prefer_const_constructors: true  # Improve performance and prevent modification
    prefer_const_declarations: true  # Improve performance and prevent modification
    secure_pubspec_urls: true  # Ensure secure dependencies
